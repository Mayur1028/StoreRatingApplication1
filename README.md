## 3. üõ† Database Setup

This project uses Sequelize for database management, so you do not need XAMPP or phpMyAdmin unless you prefer to use them.

###Requirements

Install MySQL Server (standalone version) on your system.

[MySQL Community Server Download](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

Configure .env file with your MySQL credentials:

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=your_mysql_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=reviewapp

üîπ Make sure to replace your_mysql_username and your_mysql_password with your MySQL user credentials.

Optional: You can still use XAMPP if you prefer, just make sure the credentials match your .env file.

## 4. Configure Environment Variables If Needed:

```bash
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=reviewapp
JWT_SECRET=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWUsImlhdCI6MTUxNjIzOTAyMn0.KMUFsIDTnFmyG3nMiGM6H9FNFUROf3wh7SmqJp-QV30

## ‚úÖ Pre-Registered Users (For Testing)

### Admin

Email: admin@admin.com

Password: Admin@123

### Store Owner

Email: raju12@gmail.com

Password: Mayur@123

### Normal User

Email: mayur@gmail.com

Password: Mayur@123

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

In this application, a Store Owner cannot register themselves.

The challenge specification only mentions that Normal Users can register via the registration page.

There is no mention of Store Owners being able to self-register.

üëâ Therefore, to follow the specification and keep the system secure:

An extra field role was added in the Admin ‚Üí Add User functionality.

This allows the Admin to manually create a user with the role store_owner.

‚úÖ Additionally, when the Admin assigns a store to a Normal User, that user‚Äôs role is automatically updated to store_owner.
This ensures proper role management in the system.
