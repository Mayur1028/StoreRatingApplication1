## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

In this application, a Store Owner cannot register themselves.

The challenge specification only mentions that Normal Users can register via the registration page.

There is no mention of Store Owners being able to self-register.

üëâ Therefore, to follow the specification and keep the system secure:

An extra field role was added in the Admin ‚Üí Add User functionality.

This allows the Admin to manually create a user with the role store_owner.

‚úÖ Additionally, when the Admin assigns a store to a Normal User, that user‚Äôs role is automatically updated to store_owner.
This ensures proper role management in the system.
